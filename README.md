### Current functionality:
- Pause during sorting then select a different algorithm and continue sorting
- Change color of the visualization
- Enable or disable the sort being rendered in a gradient based on individual values
- Show each individual step of the sort either through the setting "Show Every Step" or by using the slowdown feature (below)
- Slow down the sort by a certain amount
- Change the scale of the sort and have either more or less values to sort and render
